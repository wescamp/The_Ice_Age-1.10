      story= _ "Jobath had a strange feeling after he vanished. He found himself standing in a dark abyss, where no light could touch. When he looked ahead he saw a thin bridge, as thin and sharp as a sword, that led into the darkness ahead. A pit like lava seethed below it. As he crossed the bridge, the sharp edge bit into his feet. He reached the other side, and felt solid ground beneath him. Then he looked up, and saw a bright light..."

      story= _ "Jobath suddenly awakened. He was all alone, under a great tree. He turned and looked around for someone, anyone, but no one was there. When he looked on the ground nearby, he saw Geannan's cloak, in a crumpled pile. He looked again for Geannan but saw nobody. Finally, Jobath decided to leave the cave, for he was in a cave, and find out where he was."
